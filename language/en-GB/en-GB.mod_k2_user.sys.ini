MOD_K2_USER="K2 user"
K2_MOD_K2_USER_DESCRIPTION="K2 User is a better version of the Joomla! login module. Use it to display a login box for your users. When users are logged in, they see the user block (toolbar), which allows them to perform tasks like: add/edit K2 items (based on their access rights), moderate comments to their items (again, based on their access rights), update their personal details (profile) and quickly access all their published items (the user page/blog). This module replaces the 'K2 Login' module in v2.5 and later. If you are using the 'K2 Login' module, please make sure you replace it with this one. In v2.6 of K2, the 'K2 Login' module will be permanently removed from the K2 extension package."
